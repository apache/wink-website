Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Apache Wink site is built using Apache Maven. This file describes how to change the content of site
and how to deploy the site's content under http://incubator.apache.org/wink.


Site Content
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Currently site content is being built using the APT, Confluence and FML file formats. In order to add
the content to the site, create a file in one of the above formats under the proper folder and place 
a link to a new file. Pay attention that if you file is called "index.apt" the link should be to
"index.html".
The menu links are added to the "site.xml" file.

Building Local Site
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Run "mvn site" and check the local site under the target folder.


Deploying Site to Apache
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In order to deploy a site to Apache, follow the following steps:

1. Make sure that you manage to create a local site.
2. Check that distributionManagement.site.ssh-repository.url point to "scpexe://people.apache.org/www/incubator.apache.org/wink"
3. Windows users should also do the following:
3.1. Download "plink" 
3.2. Put the following section to settings.xml:
<settings>
  ...
  <servers>
    <server>
      <id>ssh-repository</id>
      <username>your username in the remote system if different from local</username>
      <privateKey>/path/to/your/private/key</privateKey> <!-- not needed if using pageant -->
      <configuration>
        <sshExecutable>plink</sshExecutable>
        <scpExecutable>pscp</scpExecutable>
        <sshArgs>other arguments you may need</sshArgs>
      </configuration>
    </server>
  </servers>
  ...
</settings>
3.3. Refer to http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-deploy-plugin/examples/deploy-ssh-external.html 
if you have additional problems.
4. Run "mvn clean site site-deploy"
5. Don't forget to commit changes you did to site to the SVN repository. However, don't commit target folder!
